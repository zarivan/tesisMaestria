\specialhead{Abstract}
The spectroscopy is a measurement technique to study the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter.
Within the broad electromagnetic spectrum, this work will focus on ultraviolet light (UV) and visible light (VIS). Today there are equipment on the market capable of performing optical spectroscopy, however, most of them have high costs. Taking advantage of laboratory equipment that is available, an automated spectroscopic system has been developed. \\
The system consists of a SpectraPro 275 monochromator, a photomultiplier tube (PMT) module and a stepper motor. Which will be controlled by a microcontroller and a PC. \\
The working range of this spectrometer is from 200 to 650 nm, with an average step of 0.05 nm. \\
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed in LabView, a microcontroller was used to control the sistem and an ADC to data acquisition.
