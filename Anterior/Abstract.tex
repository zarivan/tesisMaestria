\specialhead{Abstract}
The spectroscopy is a measurement technique to study the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter.
Within the broad electromagnetic spectrum, this work is focused on ultraviolet light (UV) and visible light (VIS). Nowadays there are equipment avaible on the market capable of performing automated optical spectroscopy however, it is expensive. Using available  laboratory equipment, an automated spectroscopic system has been developed. \\
The system consists of a SpectraPro 275 monochromator, a photomultiplier tube (PMT) module and a stepper motor. The system is controlled by a microcontroller and a PC. \\
The wavelength working range of this spectrometer is from 200 to 650 nm, with an average step of 0.05 nm. \\
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed in LabView, a microcontroller was used to control the system and an analog to digital converter (ADC) to data acquisition.
