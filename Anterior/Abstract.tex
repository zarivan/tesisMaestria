\specialhead{Abstract}
The spectroscopy is a measurement technique to study the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter.
Within the broad electromagnetic spectrum, this work is focused on ultraviolet light (UV) and visible light (VIS). Nowadays there are avaible equipment on the market capable of performing automatizard optical spectroscopy however, most of them are expensive. Using available  laboratory equipment, an automated spectroscopic system has been developed. \\
The system consists of a SpectraPro 275 monochromator, a photomultiplier tube (PMT) module and a stepper motor. Which will be controlled by a microcontroller and a PC. \\
The working range of this spectrometer is from 200 to 650 nm, with an average step of 0.05 nm. \\
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed in LabView, a microcontroller was used to control the sistem and an ADC to data acquisition.
